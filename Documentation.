AWS Transfer Family: Use AWS Transfer Family to create an SFTP server in the eu-west-1 region.

AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM): Create an IAM policy that allows the agencies to
upload files to the designated S3 bucket and restricts their access to only the necessary resources.
Apply this policy to the IAM user created for each agency

Amazon S3: Create an S3 bucket in the eu-west-1 region to serve as the landing zone for the data
uploaded by the agencies. Configure the bucket to enforce server-side encryption for data-at-rest
and enable access logging for auditing purposes.

AWS Lambda: Set up an AWS Lambda function to process the uploaded files.

Amazon CloudWatch Events: Create a CloudWatch Events rule to schedule a Lambda function that
checks.

Configure provider:
SFTP.TF

provider &quot;aws&quot; {
region = &quot;us-west-2&quot;
}

resource &quot;aws_transfer_server&quot; &quot;sftp_server&quot; {
identity_provider_type = &quot;SERVICE_MANAGED&quot;
tags = {
Name = &quot;MySFTPServer&quot;
}
}

resource &quot;aws_transfer_user&quot; &quot;sftp_user&quot; {
server_id = aws_transfer_server.sftp_server.id
user_name = &quot;sftpuser&quot;
home_directory = &quot;/sftpuser&quot;
}

Resource &quot;aws_s3_bucket&quot; &quot;s3_bucket&quot; {
Bucket = &quot;my-s3-bucket&quot;
acl = &quot;private&quot;
}

Frugality: To keep the AWS bill as small as possible, consider optimizing the resources used.
Leverage AWS Free Tier-eligible services, utilize appropriate instance types and sizes, and implement
lifecycle policies in S3 to transition and expire data as per business requirements.
